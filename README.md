# autorename

This script renames the files in a directory to a new name based on each
file's modification time and md5 hash for recognized extensions.

## Synopsis

Do you have a directory tree full of files that you clipped from the Internet
that you want to keep, but they all have nonsensical and unhelpful names that
makes the whole thing turn into a big unorganized pile? If so, this script is
for you!

This script turns an unwieldy tree of bizarrely-named files into one with files
that at least sort in the order they were created. It renames files to a name
based on the file's modification time and md5 hash, with a few configurable
options. It also deletes all those pesky `.DS_Store` files that macOS likes to
create.

Features:

* Renames files to a name based on the file's modification time and md5 hash.
  For example:

  ```text
  Copy of IMAGE-1 (2).JPG -> 2020-01-01-98ecf8427e.jpg
  ```

  The first 10 characters of the md5 hash are used to avoid collisions:

  ```text
  d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e
  ^^^^^^^^^^......................
  ```

  (The front of the hash is used just like git, as opposed to the back of the
  hash like GPG.)

* Supports naming files with **day** or **minute** granularity in a directory
  (and its subdirectories) via the placement of `.autorename.ini` configuration
  files.

* Recognizes specific file extensions and renames them accordingly. Skips the
  rest.

* Can be run in a dry-run mode to see what it would do without actually doing
  anything.

* Skips files that start with prefixes that look like dates and words, such as
  `2020-01-01 My Picture.jpg` or `2020-01-XX My Picture.jpg`. This way, if
  you had renamed files to get them "close enough" to date ordering but with
  descriptive file names, they won't get renamed.

* Deletes all those pesky `.DS_Store` files that macOS likes to create.

## Configuration

The script can be configured to name files with **day** or **minute**
granularity in a directory (and its subdirectories) via the placement of
`.autorename.ini` configuration files. The script will look for these files
in the directory tree, starting from the directory containing the file to
be renamed and going up to the root directory, stopping at the first
`.autorename.ini` file it finds.

The configuration file is a simple INI file with the following format:

```ini
[autorename]
prefix_timestamp = <day | minute>
```

The `prefix_timestamp` option can be set to either `day` or `minute`. If
this option is not set, the script will default to `day` granularity.

  | Option | Example                        |
  |--------|--------------------------------|
  | day    | 2020-01-01-98ecf8427e.jpg      |
  | minute | 2020-01-01-1234-98ecf8427e.jpg |

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:** In the future, it would be great to support the configuration
> of arbitrary prefix format configurations, but that's a real pain to test
> at runtime to prevent a misconfiguration from renaming files in a way that
> could be destructive.

## Usage

Invoke the script with arguments including directory names and file
names:

```bash
autorename.py [--commit] <files | directories...>
```

For example:

First, run in dryrun mode (default) to see what it would do:

```bash
python ./autorename.py ~/Clippings
```

Then, run with `--commit` to actually rename the files:

```bash
python ./autorename.py --commit ~/Clippings
```
